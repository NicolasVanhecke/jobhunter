## Development time

I have tracked my time during development via [Clockify](https://clockify.me/). I have spent 9 to 10 hours on the complete setup form scratch, to the result in this repository. This is without watching some tutorials and reading Laravel docs, I estimate this to be 2 extra hours.

## Used websites

- [Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs).
- [Laracasts: Laravel 8 from scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch/).
